            <h3>SIGN LANGUAGE TO TEXT CONVERSION USING FLEX SENSOR</h3>
            <p>
                Speech is the easiest way for communication in the world. It becomes difficult for speech-impaired people to communicate with normal people as they use sign language for communication.<br><br>
                In this project, we developed an Arduino-based sign language to text conversion system to help deaf people. Sign language is a natural way of communication between normal and deaf individuals, mostly dependent on hand gesture recognition.<br><br>
                Sometimes, it is not easy for normal people to recognize the signs properly and understand what they want to say. The intention of the gloves is to make the lifestyle of deaf and dumb people easier.
